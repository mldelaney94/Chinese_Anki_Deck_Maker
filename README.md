# Chinese_Anki_Deck_Maker

This repo contains program files for the chinese language interpreter that I wrote for my
anki deck creator called 'name_here'

The aim of the repo is to use natural language processing to find all meaningful 'words'
in the text, then add semantic information to them like their pinyin; their english meanings
and to tag them with useful information like 'noun' or 'surname' or their 
[zipf frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law).
This information, formatted in a list of lists, will be used to create an anki deck of the
words.
